# Baltimore-City-Employee-Salary-Cluster-Analysis
### Analyzing how different employees in Baltimore City are grouped based upon gross pay, annual pay, and days worked.

## Background
Baltimore City provides a large amount of [data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Government/Baltimore-City-Employees-Salaries/w28m-utix) relating to the individual salaries of each different employee. Baltimore City is in over [$3 billion of debt](https://www.mdpolicy.org/policyblog/detail/baltimores-economy-principles-for-recovery#:~:text=Baltimore%20was%2C%20of%20course%2C%20already,in%20terms%20of%20financial%20health.), and the financial health of the city is very insecure.  Recovering from this debt is a difficult process, as many of their costs are fixed from annual gauranteed salaries and pensions.  Thus, the only option to eliminate this deficit is to raise taxes, a choice that only accelerates the rate of people fleeing the city. This project will use [Baltimore City Open Data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Government/Baltimore-City-Employees-Salaries/w28m-utix) in order to group employees based upon their annual income, gross income, and days worked in order to see which city workers are exacerbating this problem (either through inflated salaries or other means).
